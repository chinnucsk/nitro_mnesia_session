nitro_mnesia_session
====================

Session handler for Nitrogen web app using Mnesia as a backend.


Usage
=====

1. Put this repository in site/src/handlers/ (as a submodule if you prefer)

2. Add to nitrogen_${your_server}:start/2:
   mnesia_session_handler:install()

3. Add handler in nitrogen_${your_server}:loop/1 just before nitrogen:run():
   nitrogen:handler(mnesia_session_handler, [])

4. Recompile & restart


Tests
=====

There is some basic eunit stuff, but there's no external tests
runner. First you should answer yourself a question if you want to
modify db in ram during tests, or on a disc, or maybe rollback the
whole thing. Just run tests manually from within your node in the
conditions you prefer.
