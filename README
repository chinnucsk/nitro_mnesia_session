nitro_mnesia_session
====================

Session handler for Nitrogen web app using Mnesia as a backend.


Usage
=====

1. Put this repository in site/src/handlers/ (as a submodule if you prefer)

2. Add to nitrogen_${your_server}:start/2:
   mnesia_session_handler:install()

3. Add handler in nitrogen_${your_server}:loop/1 just before nitrogen:run():
   nitrogen:handler(mnesia_session_handler, [])

4. Recompile & restart


Tests
=====

There is some basic eunit stuff, but there's no external tests
runner. Whatever is written to the db during tests is rolled back.
If you prefer that tests wouldn't touch the disc at all, run them
manually in the conditions of your choice (eg. switching tables to
ram_copies).
